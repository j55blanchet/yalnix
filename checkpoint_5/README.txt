Yalnix Project
Checkpoint 5
Julien Blanchet and Jae Heon Lee

We have achieved goals for checkpoint 5.

Disregard the one compiling warning. We are checking against a misuse in program which causes the warning.

There are five test programs. Each can be tested by:
- Open run (bash shell script) with a text editor.
- De-comment (delete the '#' character) one among five commented lines.
- Follow instructions below.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- make          -- to build Yalnix.
- run           -- to run Yalnix and see trace file for test programs.
- cat trace.txt -- to see trace file.
- make clean    -- to remove built programs.
