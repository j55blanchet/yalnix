Yalnix Project
Checkpoint 3
Julien Blanchet and Jae Heon Lee

We have achieved goals for checkpoint 3.
Code for InitProcess.c contains tests for GetPid(), Delay(), and Brk().
Trace will show that context switching occurs between InitProcess and IdleProcess. Trace will also show evidence of GetPid(), Delay(), and Brk().

INSTRUCTIONS:
- make          -- to build Yalnix.
- run           -- to run Yalnix and see trace file.
- cat trace.txt -- to see trace file.
- make clean    -- to remove built programs.
