Yalnix Project
Checkpoint 4
Julien Blanchet and Jae Heon Lee

We have achieved goals for checkpoint 4.

run1 tests Exec(). run2 tests Wait(). Fork() is used in both cases.

Disregard the one compiling warning. We are checking against a misuse in program which causes the warning.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- make          -- to build Yalnix.
- run1          -- to run Yalnix and see trace file for testing Exec().
- run2          -- to run Yalnix and see trace file for testing Wait().
- cat trace.txt -- to see trace file.
- make clean    -- to remove built programs.
